## Automation Project 


In this project, I intend to discover test automation through a simple usecase:
Testing a simple functionality of the Lusha website. 

My learning goals are the following:
- Pytest 
- Selenium
- Page Object Model Design Pattern

**The flow:**
- Create an automation test based on Python selenium, and use Pytest for it.
- Access to Lusha main page: https://www.lusha.com/
- Click on the "Contact Sales" button (placed on the top right said of the page)
- Fill the first and second form
- Select "Business Partner" in the combo box.
- Fill the text in the text box
- Do not Press Submit

**Tests:**
- Write several automation tests for this form (for each test you can change the inputs for validations),
- Inside of every test function write comments and explain about the test
- Use asserts for validation.
